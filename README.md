# üõ°Ô∏è domain-repo-monitor
Keeps an eye out for sneaky repo clones trying to steal your domain‚Äôs identity. A plug-and-play GitHub Actions watchdog for your name.

This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow for monitoring **unauthorized copies of domain-named repositories**. It is designed to help independent researchers, creators, and developers detect misuse, impersonation, or license violations of their publicly published repositories.

---

## Purpose
Many researchers and creators publish content tied to a personal or project domain (e.g., `www.example.com`). When these repositories are cloned without attribution‚Äîor worse, used to impersonate the original author‚Äîit can create reputational and security risks.

This workflow:
- Scans GitHub for repositories with names matching key domain patterns
- Checks if they contain identity-signaling files (`CNAME`, `LICENSE`, or `index.md`)
- Opens a GitHub issue if a potential copy is found

---

## Files Included
- `.github/workflows/monitor.yml` ‚Äì GitHub Actions workflow (see below)
- `LICENSE` ‚Äì Released under the MIT License

> üîó **Live reference implementation:**  
> See it in use at  
> [rdcj-research.github.io ‚Äì monitor.yml](https://github.com/rdcj-research/rdcj-research.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/monitor.yml)

---

## How to Use
1. Copy the example workflow below to a `monitor.yml` file to `.github/workflows/` in your own repository
2. Edit the list of target domain names here:
   ```bash
   declare -a targets=("www.example.com" "www.anotherdomain.org")
   ```
3. Replace the login exclusion check with your GitHub username or use:
   ```bash
   select(.owner.login != "${{ github.repository_owner }}")
   ```
4. Commit and push


## Setup Instructions (External Cron + GitHub Action)
**If needed, Uuse an external cron job to trigger this daily.**

### 1. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token
- Go to [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
- Create a token (workflow ‚Üí Read and write)
- Copy the token (you‚Äôll only see it once)

---

### 2. Set Up a Cron Job (e.g. [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org))
- Go to [https://cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org)
- Sign up and create a new cron job

**Request:**
- Method: `POST`
- URL: https://api.github.com/repos/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/actions/workflows/monitor.yml/dispatches
- Headers:
- `Accept: application/vnd.github+json`
- `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `Content-Type: application/json`
- Body:
```json
{
  "ref": "main"
}
```

Schedule: Daily at your preferred time
